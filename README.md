# Movie-Review-Prediction
A Generic text classifier that puts movie review texts into one of two categories â€” negative or positive sentiment
## Naive Bayes Classifier
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing problem where text is understood and the underlying intent is predicted. In this project we will discover how we can predict the sentiment of movie reviews as either positive or negative in Python using the Naive Bayes Classifier.

what we will discover in this project are:

 - About the sentiment analysis problem for natural language processing and how to load it in Naive Bayes.
 - How to use **Bag of word** model for data cleaning 
 - How to work with files in python
 - How to make prediction using Multinomial Naive Bayes and Multivariate Bernoulli Naive Bayes. 
 - How to get score of your prediction

The words have been replaced by integers that indicate the absolute popularity of the word in the dataset. The sentences in each review are therefore comprised of a sequence of integers.
